# SPPU 2019 Pattern SE-COMP Sem-III Practicals

**Welcome to the SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-COMP-Sem-III-Practicals Repository!**  

This repository contains the practical codes for Semester III of the SE-COMP program under the 2019 Pattern at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). It includes assignments from the **Data Structures Laboratory (DSL)**, **Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (OOPL)**, and **Computer Graphics Laboratory (CGL)**.  

These practicals were coded with inputs from various resources, and while you can use them as a reference, it's highly recommended to study, experiment, and make them your own to truly understand the concepts. A PDF of the syllabus and the DSL lab manual is also included for your convenience.  

Feel free to explore and reach out if you encounter any issues. Happy coding, and all the best!


## Deployment

**Deploying These Codes**  

To successfully run the practical codes in this repository, ensure you have the appropriate environments and libraries set up for each subject:  

1. **Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (OOPL):**  
   - Requires a C++ environment, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio.  
   - Install GCC: [GCC Official Page](https://gcc.gnu.org/)  

2. **Computer Graphics Laboratory (CGL):**  
   - Requires a C++ environment along with a Graphics library like OpenGL or the graphics.h library.  
   - OpenGL: [OpenGL Official Page](https://www.opengl.org/)  
   - Graphics.h: Check installation instructions specific to your environment.  

3. **Data Structures Laboratory (DSL):**  
   - Requires both a C++ environment and a Python environment (for assignments involving Python).  
   - Install Python: [Python Official Page](https://www.python.org/)  
   - Ensure the C++ setup is functional as described above.  

**General Notes:**  
- Ensure compilers or interpreters are correctly installed and paths are set in your system's environment variables.  
- For IDE-based setups, check documentation specific to your chosen IDE.  
- Detailed installation and troubleshooting guides can be found on the official pages linked above.  

Feel free to use the provided syllabus PDF for additional guidance on these setups.
