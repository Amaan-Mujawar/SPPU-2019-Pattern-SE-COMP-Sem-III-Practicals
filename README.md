# SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-COMP-Sem-III-Practicals Repository

Welcome to the **SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-COMP-Sem-III-Practicals** Repository!

This repository contains the practical codes for **Semester III** of the **SE-COMP** program under the **2019 Pattern** at **Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)**. It includes assignments from the following subjects:

- **Data Structures Laboratory (DSL)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (OOPL)**
- **Computer Graphics Laboratory (CGL)**

## About This Repository
These practicals have been implemented using **C++** (and **Python** where applicable), adhering to the university syllabus. While this repository serves as a reference, it is highly recommended that you **study, experiment, and modify the codes** to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.

A **PDF of the syllabus and relevant manuals** is also included for additional guidance.

## Deployment
### Running the Practical Codes
To successfully compile and execute the practical codes in this repository, ensure that you have the necessary development environments and libraries installed for each subject.

#### **Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (OOPL)**
- Requires a **C++ environment** such as **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** or an IDE like **Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio**.
- **Installation Links:**
  - [GCC Official Page](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  - [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
  - [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

#### **Computer Graphics Laboratory (CGL)**
- Requires a **C++ environment** with additional graphics libraries such as **OpenGL** or **graphics.h**.
- **Installation Links:**
  - [OpenGL Official Page](https://www.opengl.org/)
  - [Graphics.h Installation Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-turbo-c-for-graphics-programming/)

#### **Data Structures Laboratory (DSL)**
- Requires both **C++** and **Python** environments (for Python-based assignments).
- **Installation Links:**
  - [Python Official Page](https://www.python.org/)
  - Ensure your C++ setup is properly configured as mentioned above.

## General Notes
- Ensure compilers, interpreters, and necessary libraries are correctly installed and environment paths are set.
- For IDE-based setups, refer to the official documentation of your preferred IDE.
- If you face issues, check the official troubleshooting guides for installation and setup.

Feel free to explore and contribute! **Happy coding, and best of luck with your studies!** ðŸš€
